CronFrequency
=============

Try to make the cron frequency easy to read.  
Example : 30 19 1 * * -> every 1st of the month at 19:30

How to use it
-------------------------

Here is a sample if you receive the data from POST.

```php
$data = explode(' ', $_POST['cronFrequency']);
list($minute, $hour, $dayOfMonth, $month, $dayOfWeek) = $data;
$cron = new CronFrequency($minute, $hour, $dayOfMonth, $month, $dayOfWeek);
echo $cron->toHuman();
```
